A framework for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models and pipelines.

Overview
This repository aims to provide tools and Jupyter notebooks to systematically evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of RAG-based systems. RAG combines information retrieval with generative language models to answer questions, summarize documents, or generate context-aware responses.

This project is designed for researchers, engineers, and practitioners who want to:

  1. Test and benchmark different RAG architectures
  
  2. Analyze retrieval and generation performance
  
  3. Customize the evaluation pipeline for various datasets

Features
  1. Evaluation scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for:
  
    a. Measuring retrieval relevance and accuracy
    
    b. Assessing generative quality (e.g., factual correctness, fluency)
    
    c. Analyzing end-to-end performance metrics
  
  2. Modular structure for integrating custom retrieval and generation components
  
  3. Open to contributions and extensions (additional metrics, evaluation datasets, model adapters)
